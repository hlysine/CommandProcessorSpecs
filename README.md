# Command Processor

This is a programming exercise that simulates real-world programming experiences, where future feature requirements are unknown
and thus writing future-proof code is essential. This exercise starts off with very basic requirements and progressively adds
new features in newer versions.

## Rules

- You may NOT read the specs for future version before completing the current version.
- You may use any programming language to complete this exercise.
- If a situation/user input is unspecified, your program is free to react in whatever way you prefer. Even crashes are accepted.

When you have completed the whole exercise, read your code again and see what you would've done differently if you'd known the
full specs at the beginning!
